# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds expectations**: Great job of planning this out. I really appreciate the detail of your readme. One area to improve would be your commit history. I'd strongly encourage you to try to make sure all your commits are intentional and have "good" commit messages. Look into how to "undo" a commit. (Hint: `git reset --soft head~`)

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds expectations**: Great use of Bootstrap and other design themes. I'm a sucker for handwritten CSS, but at the end of the day the important thing is whether or not it looks good -- and this looks great! The program appears to work well. An area of improvement would be preventing the users from entering invalid input (e.g. `aaa` instead of `1`). Better yet: make each choice clickable, and forego the input field altogether. Look into the `input[type=radio]+label` css selector.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**: As you know, code organization is the thing with which you struggled the most. However, what you've created certainly works, and is relatively easy to read. I left several inline comments in the code to which you can refer. Please see my pull request on your repo.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds expectations**: I would encourage you to not be too overly-reliant on CSS/JS libraries -- at least not while you're in this class. Overall, great job with this project!
