### Installation
This game is hosted at GitHub pages [here](http://www.verticalupdesign.com/wdi-project1/).

### Technologies Used
This game was built with the following core web technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery

### Approach taken
I took an iterative approach to building out the user stories below. The focus was on building core functionality first to a MVP level. Then adding on CSS and styling.

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to read a question and have multiple choices presented, so I can pick the best answer.
2. As a user, I want to enter my selection in an input field, so I can tell the computer my choice.
3. As a user, I want my answer evaluated for correctness when I click on the "Submit" button, so I can see if I was right or wrong.
4. As a user, I want my score incremented or decremented if I get the question right or wrong, respectively, so I can keep track of my progress.
5. As a user, I want the ability to post my high score to a leaderboard, so that I can see my progress over time.

### Lessons Learned
- Arrays are easier to loop through than nested objects
- Don't overthink loops - get it working, then refactor
- Styling/CSS skills need some work and take a LOT of time if you let it
- JQuery is fantastic for taegeting and acting on the DOM
- Use GitHub to view others repos to get ideas & ask questions about the source code when you are stuck

### Known Issues
- CSS& Bootstrap is not exactly breath-taking
- JQuery animation is "jerky"
- Hacks to get alignment in Navbar

### Future Enhancements
- "High Score" leaderboard that persists over time

### Worklog
#### Deliverables
- [x] 5 user stories  
- [x] hosted on GH Pages  
- [ ] HTML/CSS validated  
- [x] lots of commits  
- [x] readme with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc  

#### Core
- [x] allow input submission with enter key (not clicking on button)
- [x] CSS & bootstrap tweaks
- [x] Deploy final to Github

#### Options
- randomize questions
- user can add questions

#### Bonus
  * Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.
  * Add time-based scoring
  * Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)

#### DONE
- [x] Question properties
  - question has multiple possibleAnswers (1-3)
  - question has an single correctAnswer (1-3)  
- [x] Ask player for input  
- [x] If input matches AnswerKey then show "correct" and go to next question
- [x] reset input screen to blank
- [x] score increments for correct answer, decrements for wrong answer
- [x] actual questions in bank


## GA Criteria

### Self-scoring Trivia
Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how
right you are!

*Bonus:*
  * Add time-based scoring
  * Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
  * Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.

#### Necessary Deliverables

  * A **hosted copy of your game or app, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages
    * Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  * A **git repository hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
    * A **link to your hosted project** in the URL section of your Github repo
    * **A ``readme.md`` file**, including
      * Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
      * At least 5 [user stories](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/02-intermediate-front-end/process-stories-wireframes).


#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
**2** | _Exceeds expectations_

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

#### Schedule
- Anything not specified here will be considered project work time. Take some time to eat lunch and take breaks. Attendance will be taken at 9 in the classrooms each morning.

Day | Time | Event | who
----- | ------------ | ----- | -----
Monday/Tuesday | TBA | One-on-ones | individual
Tuesday | 1:30 - 3:00 | Outcomes | Classrooms 5 & 1
Tuesday | 3:30 - 5:00 | Outcomes | Classroom 4
Wednesday | 2:00 - 4:30 | Project 1 Presentations | everyone

#### Presentations

All presentations will be science fair style. There will be 3 separate groups. During your group's 45-minute block, you'll set up at a table and demo / discuss your project with the non-presenting students as they walk around.

#### Schedule for Presentations
You'll be assigned a group number on the day of the presentation.

time|group
----- |-----
2:00 - 2:45 | 1
2:50 - 3:35| 2
3:45 - 4:30| 3
